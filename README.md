# IOT-based-health-care-monitoring-system

The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a powerful technology that has the potential to revolutionize healthcare systems. The IoT-based patient health monitoring system allows for continuous and remote monitoring of patients' vital signs, activities, and overall well-being, thereby enabling proactive interventions and personalized care plans. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this system could have played a crucial role in early detection, remote patient management, and reducing the strain on healthcare facilities. By leveraging IoT devices and connectivity, healthcare providers could have remotely monitored COVID-19 patients, tracked their symptoms, and ensured timely medical interventions. 

## Problem Statement:
The COVID-19 pandemic had overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide. This pandemic had underscored the critical role of technology in healthcare delivery especially in rural areas. So, a need of certain system or device arose in order to monitor health of patient from any part of the world.

## Proposed Solution:
The IoT-based patient health monitoring system that we have developed in the form of wearable band incorporates the LM34 temperature sensor, a pulse sensor, and the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The LM34 temperature sensor provides accurate temperature readings, enabling continuous monitoring of patients' body temperature. The pulse sensor tracks heart rate and ensures real-time monitoring of patients' cardiovascular health. These sensors, combined with the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, enable data transmission to the cloud for analysis and remote access by healthcare providers.
